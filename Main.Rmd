## R Markdown

Data breaches in the US healthcare industry have been a persistent
problem over the past decade. Between 2009 and 2019, numerous healthcare
organisations experienced data breaches, resulting in the unauthorised
access or disclosure of sensitive patient information. These breaches
have had serious consequences for both patients and healthcare
organisations, including financial losses, damage to reputation, and
loss of trust. This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple
formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For
more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

GFG <- data.frame(
  State         =   datafrom$State, 
  Frequency= datafrom$Individuals.Affected

)

GFG %>% group_by(State)%>%
 summarise(individual=mean(Frequency))%>%

    ggplot(aes(x=State,fill=State,y=individual)) +  
     geom_col(position = "dodge") +
     labs(title="Affect individuals according state wise USA")


#########
#How many times did each organisation get hacked
#How many times do data types lose / hack a particular organisation?
#########
Organization <- data.frame(
       Name         = datafrom$Name.of.Covered.Entity, 
       Date         = datafrom$Breach.Submission.Date
)




#Organization %>% group_by(Name)%>%
 # summarise(date=mean(Date))%>%
  
  #  ggplot(aes(x=Name,fill=Name,y=as.numeric(date)))  +
   # geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    #labs(title="each organisation get hacked") 
  
  

#########
#What was the central tendency of healthcare data breach by a year?
# 2015 to 2019  
#########

dataSubmission <-  data.frame(Date 
                              = substring(datafrom$Breach.Submission.Date,0,4))


dataSubmission <- dataSubmission %>% filter(dataSubmission$Date >='2019' & dataSubmission$Date  <= '2019'
                                            | dataSubmission$Date >='2018' & dataSubmission$Date  <= '2018'

                                            | dataSubmission$Date >='2016' & dataSubmission$Date  <= '2016'
                                            | dataSubmission$Date >='2015' & dataSubmission$Date  <= '2015'
                  ) 
  


mean(as.numeric(dataSubmission$Date),na.rm=TRUE)

hist(as.numeric(dataSubmission$Date),
     xlab="Count",
     ylab="Central tendency of healthcare data breach by a year",
     ylim=c(0,500),
     xlim=c(2015,2019),
     col="darkmagenta"
)


#############
#
#When was the worst year for an overall number of healthcare data breaches
#############
worstYear <- getmode(dataSubmission$Date)
print(worstYear)










```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
